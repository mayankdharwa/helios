# Custom topic lifecycle

The `exploration/custom/` topic is an optional 5th exploration step for sub-explorations that don't fit the standard four (`schema`, `apis`, `jobs`, `code-structure`). When `custom/` belongs vs other topics: `reference/custom-shape.md` "When custom belongs (and when it doesn't)".

Lazy-created on first sub-exploration. Each sub-exploration is the unit of lock. The skill enforces the topic-level shape (INDEX.md, PROGRESS.md, archive layout); internal structure inside a sub-exploration folder is flexible and is drafted collaboratively with the user via the authoring workflow in `reference/custom-shape.md`.

## Preconditions

- Feature dir is active.
- User has identified a body of design work that doesn't fit the standard four topics. If it fits one of the four, route there instead — `custom/` is the escape hatch, not the default.
- For a new sub-exploration entry: a kebab-case sub-exploration name and a one-line hook for INDEX.md.

## Add a sub-exploration

### 1. Confirm the sub-exploration is worth a folder

Apply the gate: does this body of work warrant a folder of its own? If it's a single decision or a single document, it likely belongs inline in an existing topic or as a single `references/` file. Custom sub-explorations are multi-file, multi-decision bodies of work.

### 2. Get sub-exploration name and hook from user

Ask:
- **Folder name** — kebab-case, descriptive (e.g., `exotel-applets`, `prescription-templates`).
- **INDEX.md hook** — one line: what this sub-exploration covers, when a future reader should open the folder.

Validate the folder name doesn't already exist under `custom/`.

### 3. Lazy-create `custom/` if missing

If `docs/<feature>/exploration/custom/` doesn't exist:

1. Create the directory `exploration/custom/`.
2. Create `exploration/custom/INDEX.md` with header only:
   ```markdown
   # Custom explorations

   One line per sub-exploration: short hook describing what it covers and when to read it. Stable nav — no status here; status lives in PROGRESS.md.
   ```
3. Create `exploration/custom/PROGRESS.md` from `templates/progress-topic.md` with an empty `## Progress` table and a kickoff narrative in `## Current focus` naming the sub-exploration from step 2 as the first focus. Mirrors `procedures/bootstrap.md` step 6 for standard topics — table starts empty; the row is added in step 6 below.
4. Update top-level `PROGRESS.md`: if `🚧 exploration` is already active, add pointer line `- 🚧 custom → exploration/custom/PROGRESS.md` under it. If exploration was `⏳`, flip to `🚧` and add the pointer.

If `custom/` already exists, skip to step 4.

### 4. Create the sub-exploration folder

Create `exploration/custom/<sub-exploration>/`. Outline and content come in step 7 via the authoring workflow in `reference/custom-shape.md`.

### 5. Update INDEX.md

Append one line:
```
- [<sub-exploration>/](<sub-exploration>/) — <hook>
```

INDEX.md is stable navigation; no status emoji here. Status lives in `custom/PROGRESS.md`.

### 6. Update `custom/PROGRESS.md`

Add a row to `## Progress` as `⏳` (consistent with how new units are added to standard topics — promotion to `🚧` happens when the user starts work):
```
- ⏳ <sub-exploration> → exploration/custom/<sub-exploration>/
```

One `🚧` at a time per `reference/smells.md` — when the user starts work on this sub-exploration, promote silently to `🚧`.

### 7. Summarise and enter the authoring workflow

Three to six lines per `SKILL.md` Operating posture rule 8. Cover: sub-exploration folder created, INDEX.md hook added, PROGRESS.md row state. Then enter the authoring workflow in `reference/custom-shape.md` — step 1 (agree on structure) runs first, step 2 (pick a cadence: whole-doc-then-review vs section-by-section) follows once the outline is in hand. The summary's "Next up" asks the structure question and notes that the cadence question comes next, so the user can redirect either before drafting begins.

## Sub-exploration lock

The unit-of-lock in `custom/` is the sub-exploration (one PROGRESS.md row per sub-exploration). Lock semantics mirror `procedures/unit-lock.md` with these differences:

- The Review comment callout lands in whichever internal file inside the sub-exploration the user designates. The skill does not prescribe a filename — at first lock, ask the user which file in `custom/<sub-exploration>/` holds the decisions; on subsequent locks within the same sub-exploration, re-read the folder to find existing `Review comment` callouts and continue per-file numbering.
- If the user maintains decisions across multiple internal files, each file carries its own `Review comment #N` counter (per-file monotonic, per `reference/sequence-rules.md`). The sweep at custom-topic-lock walks all `.md` files in `custom/<sub-exploration>/` to find callouts.
- Row format on flip: `- ✅ <sub-exploration> → exploration/custom/<sub-exploration>/<decisions-file>` — the pointer names the file the user designated for decisions. If decisions live in multiple files, the pointer names the folder (`exploration/custom/<sub-exploration>/`).

Otherwise — confirmation, sequence-number determination, `## Current focus` update, smell checks — proceed as in `procedures/unit-lock.md`.

If no non-deferred `⏳` rows remain after the lock, route to `procedures/topic-lock.md` with `custom` as the topic. Topic-lock works unchanged: it walks the topic's `.md` files for `Review comment` callouts (in `custom/`, this means walking all sub-exploration folders) and runs the DECISIONS sweep.

## Deferral

A sub-exploration can be deferred like any unit. Route to `procedures/defer.md`. The row becomes:
```
- ⏳ <sub-exploration> — deferred: <pointer to OPEN-QUESTIONS Q<N> or references/<file>.md>
```

Deferred sub-exploration rows participate in the loop-back at custom-topic-lock the same way deferred unit rows participate in standard-topic-lock — see `procedures/topic-lock.md` step 1.

## Errors

- Sub-exploration folder name collision: surface; ask for a more specific name.
- INDEX.md missing when sub-exploration folders already exist: drift — surface and offer to reconstruct from `ls custom/`.
- User tries to add a sub-exploration that clearly fits an existing topic (e.g., a new internal API): surface and suggest routing to the appropriate topic instead.

## Postconditions

- `exploration/custom/INDEX.md` contains one line per sub-exploration.
- `exploration/custom/PROGRESS.md` has one row per sub-exploration with its current status icon — `⏳` until work starts, `🚧` while in flight, `✅` once locked.
- Each sub-exploration has its own folder under `custom/`; internal shape is flexible and is drafted via the authoring workflow in `reference/custom-shape.md`.
- Top-level `PROGRESS.md` has `- 🚧 custom → exploration/custom/PROGRESS.md` under `🚧 exploration` while the topic is active.
